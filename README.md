# api-client-android
A sample Android app that calls the Google Genomics API.

## Getting started
* First [set up Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) 
  so that you can build and install Android apps.
* [Clone this repository](https://help.github.com/articles/working-with-repositories/)
  to your local machine
* Use Android Studio's Import Project option to create a project from
  the gradle files within your cloned directory.
* Run the app from whithin Android Studio and your connected device should see a basic
  drawer-based layout which lists datasets and jobs. 


Note: this is just a sample app, so it's not very feature rich - [contributions welcome](CONTRIBUTING.rst)!
